# Two Sum

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return *indices* of
the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may
not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

## Function Signature

```racket
(: two-sum (-> (Array Integer) Integer (Array Integer)))
```

## Examples

```text
in: nums = [11, 3, 9, 15], target = 12
out: [1, 2] or [2, 1]

in: nums = [2, 4, 3], target = 6
out: [0, 1] or [1, 0]

in: nums = [1,1], target = 2
out: [0, 1] or [1, 0]
```

## Constraints

```text
2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists, but the indexes of that answer can be in any
order.
```

## Extra

Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(nÂ²)` time complexity?
